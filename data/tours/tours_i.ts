          "In 79 AD, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius buried the thriving Roman city of Pompeii under meters of volcanic ash and pumice. The ash hermetically sealed the city, preserving buildings, frescoes, and streets exactly as they were nearly 2,000 years ago.",

          "The site offers an unparalleled look at daily Roman life. You can see ancient fast-food counters (thermopolia), political graffiti on the walls, and grooves in the stone streets worn down by the wheels of chariots."
